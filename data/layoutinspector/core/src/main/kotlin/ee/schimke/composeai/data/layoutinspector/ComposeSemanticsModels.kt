  // parses with `tokens = null`.
  // v4 (#1908): the `tokens` object gains `borderColor` (outline role), `gap` (arrangement
  // spacing), and `shape` (descriptor for non-dp shapes), and `cornerRadius` now resolves
  // percent/`CircleShape` corners against the node's size. Still additive — every new field is
  // optional, so a v3 reader parses a v4 file unchanged.
  // v5 (#1934): each text node gains a `typography` object — its resolved typographic identity
  // beyond size/colour: `fontFamily`, `fontWeight`, `fontStyle`, `fontVariationSettings` (the
  // variable-font axes actually applied), plus `fontFeatureSettings`, `letterSpacing`, and
  // `lineHeight`. The typography analogue of the v3 `tokens` addition, so a parity consumer can
  // compare *which face* the text is drawn in, not just how big. Still additive — the object is
  // optional, so a v4 reader parses a v5 file unchanged.
  // v6 (#1903): the flat `layout*` text fields are consolidated into themed sub-objects, closing
  // the
  // smell #1903 flagged. `layoutFontSize` moves to `typography.fontSize`; `layoutForegroundColor` /
  // `layoutBackgroundColor` become `textColor.{foreground,background}`; the line/overflow metrics
  // (`layoutLineCount` / `layoutMaxLines` / `layoutOverflow` / `layoutTruncated` /
  // `layoutDidOverflow{Width,Height}`) become the `textOverflow` object. **Breaking** — the flat
  // fields are removed, so a v5 reader does not see them; consumers read the sub-objects instead.
  // History compatibility: stored v5 history entries still carry the flat fields, which decode away
  // (`ignoreUnknownKeys`) into the v6 model — so diffing a render across the bump won't surface
  // changes to those text fields. The loss is a one-time artifact of the consolidation, accepted
  // rather than carrying a legacy decode path; entries captured at v6+ diff normally.
  // v7 (#1908 follow-up): tokens may carry `cornerRadiusPx` — the raw-pixel corner radius of a
  // `RoundedCornerShape(<px>f)` that the dp-only `cornerRadius` couldn't express. Additive; older
  // entries decode with `cornerRadiusPx = null`.
  // v8: `textOverflow` may carry `lines` — per-line geometry (visible substring + left + baseline,
  // px relative to the node's top-left) for wrapped text, so the figma-svg export places one run
  // per line at the render's break points instead of collapsing the string onto one baseline.
  // Additive; older entries decode with `lines = null` (single-line rendering).
  // v9: `tokens` may carry `opacity`, the effective alpha of the node's graphics layers. Additive;
  // older entries decode it as null (fully opaque).
  // v10 (#2854): typography may carry effective styled `spans`, and wrapped line entries carry
  // their UTF-16 start/end offsets. This preserves the paragraph face across AnnotatedString runs
  // while retaining explicit per-span overrides (for example Karla body text with a monospace code
