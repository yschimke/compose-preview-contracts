/**
 * Backend-agnostic model for the **layered Figma SVG** export — the design-fidelity counterpart to
 * the schematic [WireframeModel]. Where the wireframe is a flat list of stroked boxes meant to be
 * *read* (a skeleton), this model is a **nested tree of layers** meant to be *edited*: every layer
 * maps to a `<g>` in the emitted SVG (and therefore a named group/frame when Figma imports it),
 * carrying the composable name, the resolved fill/stroke/corner tokens, and — for text nodes — the
 * editable string plus its typography.
 *
 * Built from the two trees the renderer already captures per frame:
 * - [LayoutInspectorPayload] provides the **structure**: the composable
 *   [LayoutInspectorNode.component] name (retained as the layer name so a component/screen becomes
 *   a named Figma layer), the full nesting, and the modifier-derived container [tokens]
 *   (background/border colour, corner radius, shape).
 * - [ComposeSemanticsPayload] (optional) provides the **text**: a node's drawn string plus its
 *   [ComposeSemanticsTypography]/[ComposeSemanticsTextColor], matched onto the layout node with the
 *   same absolute bounds so the SVG carries editable `<text>` with the right face/size/colour.
 *
 * Pure data in root-pixel space (bounds are already absolute-to-root), so — like [WireframeModel] —
 * a single translate ([tx]/[ty]) drops it into the padded canvas. All dp/sp token values are
 * converted to px here (× density) so the renderer never has to know about density.
