/**
 * Backend-agnostic model for the **layered Figma SVG** export — the design-fidelity counterpart to
 * the schematic [WireframeModel]. Where the wireframe is a flat list of stroked boxes meant to be
 * *read* (a skeleton), this model is a **nested tree of layers** meant to be *edited*: every layer
 * maps to a `<g>` in the emitted SVG (and therefore a named group/frame when Figma imports it),
 * carrying the composable name, the resolved fill/stroke/corner tokens, and — for text nodes — the
 * editable string plus its typography.
 *
 * Built from the two trees the renderer already captures per frame:
 * - [LayoutInspectorPayload] provides the **structure**: the composable
 *   [LayoutInspectorNode.component] name (retained as the layer name so a component/screen becomes
 *   a named Figma layer), the full nesting, and the modifier-derived container [tokens]
 *   (background/border colour, corner radius, shape).
 * - [ComposeSemanticsPayload] (optional) provides the **text**: a node's drawn string plus its
 *   [ComposeSemanticsTypography]/[ComposeSemanticsTextColor], matched onto the layout node with the
 *   same absolute bounds so the SVG carries editable `<text>` with the right face/size/colour.
 *
 * Pure data in root-pixel space (bounds are already absolute-to-root), so — like [WireframeModel] —
 * a single translate ([tx]/[ty]) drops it into the padded canvas. All dp/sp token values are
 * converted to px here (× density) so the renderer never has to know about density.

     * faithfully instead of being cropped out as an opaque `<image>`. Rasterising the `SliderKt`
     * node by name would pre-empt that capture (the opaque-by-name branch drops the subtree before

     * reports the real 450dp viewport, so the clipping modifier's own box is the rendered
     * scroll-container rect the export must clip to. Without it the below-fold children stayed
     * visible in the SVG while the PNG clipped them (issue #3056).
     *
     * Containment in `bounds` is deliberately NOT required. Jetsnack's real chain ends
     * `…verticalScroll(…).clickable(…).background(…).padding(horizontal = 24.dp, vertical =
     * 16.dp).skipToLookaheadSize()`, so the innermost coordinator — the node's `bounds` — is the
     * *content* box: inset 24dp on each side by that trailing padding while overflowing the
     * viewport vertically. The rendered viewport is therefore 48dp **wider** than `bounds` at the
     * same time as it is shorter, and requiring `clip ⊆ bounds` rejected it — which is why the
     * first pass at this fixed the synthetic fixture but left the real screen leaking.
     *
     * What comes back is the **mask**: the clipping coordinator's rect, whole. The caller narrows
     * it by the node's [paintedExtent] to get the node's own box — a node whose paint is smaller
     * than its clip on the un-overflowing axis must not have its fill spread across margins the

     * inherits and the box its children place against. Jetsnack's sheet has the two coincide (its
     * `background` sits outside the trailing padding and is as wide as the clip); an ordinary
     * `size(100.dp).clip(…).requiredSize(50.dp, 200.dp).background(…)` is where they part.
     *
     * Only ever fires when the clip box *shrinks* an axis, which keeps it a no-op on ordinary
     * nodes: a plain chain places every coordinator outside the innermost one at or around it, so
     * an ordinary clip box is ≥ `bounds` on both axes and is skipped. An axis that shrinks means
