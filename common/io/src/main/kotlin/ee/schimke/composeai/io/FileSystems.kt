/**
 * The real process filesystem — the production default for all file IO.

 * A single indirection point so the codebase funnels through Okio rather than `java.io.File` /
 * `java.nio`. Use it with Okio's own blocking `read { … }` / `write { … }`. This module is
 * intentionally synchronous and coroutines-free so it stays safe on the render subprocess classpath
 * (a `kotlinx-coroutines` version skew there breaks Compose rendering — see
 * `docs/RENDERER_COMPATIBILITY.md`).
 *
 * **Injection convention.** Code that touches files takes an Okio [FileSystem] rather than reaching
 * for this constant directly: stateless functions / `object`s accept a defaulted `fileSystem:
 * FileSystem = SystemFileSystem` parameter, and stateful classes take a `private val fileSystem:
 * FileSystem = SystemFileSystem` constructor parameter. Production wiring is unchanged (the default
 * is this real filesystem), while tests inject a `FakeFileSystem` (the `okio-fakefilesystem`
 * artifact) and exercise the IO entirely in memory. The composition roots (`main` entry points) are
 * the one place that legitimately names this constant.

 * dependencies, materialised Gradle init scripts — belong here, *outside* any project tree: they're
 * caches, not sources, so they shouldn't clutter a working copy or land in version control.

 * which meant every previewed module grew an untracked directory next to its sources (and, on
 * projects that never opted in, one that appeared without the user asking). Relocating it under the
 * user-level cache root puts it alongside the font cache and bundle deps, which are the same
 * category of data.
 *
 * The reporting-branch flow is unaffected: that publishes to a git ref (see
 * `docs/daemon/REPORTING-BRANCH.md`), and the in-tree directory was only ever its local staging
 * area.
 *
 * **Legacy directories win.** When `<projectDir>/.compose-preview-history` already exists, it is
 * returned unchanged so an existing timeline isn't stranded by an upgrade. Delete it (or move it
 * under the cache root) to migrate; nothing recreates it.
 *
 * The layout must be reproduced byte-for-byte by two other implementations that can't call this one
 * — the Gradle plugin (no dependency on this module) and the VS Code extension (TypeScript).
 * [composeAiHistoryWorkspaceSlug] documents the slug contract those mirror; `HistoryPathsTest` and
 * its TS counterpart pin the same vectors on both sides.
