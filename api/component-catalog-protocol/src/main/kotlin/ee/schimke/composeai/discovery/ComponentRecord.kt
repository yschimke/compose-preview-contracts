 * @property callable the **source-level** FQN generated Kotlin imports
 *   (`androidx.compose.material3.Button`). Deriving an import from [jvmOwner] would print `import
 *   androidx.compose.material3.ButtonKt`, which does not resolve.
 * @property jvmName the JVM method name — what `Class.forName(jvmOwner).getMethod(…)` needs, and
 *   not the same string as [name] whenever Kotlin mangled it (a signature mentioning a value class
 *   gives `AppTile-a1b2c3d`). Null when not recorded, and — like [descriptor] — when overloads
 *   merged into this record disagreed: mangling is per-signature, so `Chip(label: String)` and
 *   `Chip(width: Dp)` share a source name and a canonical id while their JVM names differ.
 * @property descriptor the JVM method descriptor, which is what actually identifies *which* method
 *   is meant: two overloads mentioning no value class share both [name] and [jvmName] exactly. Null
 *   when not recorded, and also when overloads merged into this record disagreed — see
 *   [ComponentRecord.canonicalId].
 * @property origin where the symbol lives. Explicit rather than inferred from [sourceFile] being
 *   null, which also happens for a project-local file discovery could not resolve (a generated
 *   source, say) — reading that null as "library" would send a local component down the sources-jar
 *   path and discard the KDoc and fixtures available from the project.
 * @property sourceFile availability only, never a proxy for [origin].
 * @property docs where KDoc and default expressions came from. `"unavailable"` in v1 for every
 *   symbol: Kotlin metadata carries neither, and resolving a `-sources.jar` is the next step. Said
 *   explicitly so a consumer can tell "no KDoc" from "KDoc not recovered".
 * @property receiver the fully-qualified type this composable is declared as an extension on, or
 *   null when it is an ordinary function. Decides whether a call site resolves at all:
 *   `AnimatedVisibility` is declared on `ColumnScope`, so printing it at file scope is an
 *   unresolved reference rather than a style choice. Only meaningful when
